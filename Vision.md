# Vision

A polished game with aspects similar to [RimWorld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/),
but with magic and aspects of RPG.

## Goals

* High re-playability value
* Balanced gameplay
* Fun multiplayer game experience

#### Dungeons
* Should be kinda scary (Scary sound, Scary visuals, nasty monsters)
* Dungeons are spawned in the world with random difficulties
	* Go into one at your own risk
	* Higher the difficulty, the higher the reward
	* Some components for spellcasting or tech components might be found here
* Unlike games like D&D there are no restrictions on how many characters go exploring a dungeon
	* A large population might enable you to raid a more difficult dungeon, albeit with high casualties

#### Economy
* Based on supply and demand
* Everything the merchants sell has to come from somewhere
	* If supplies dry up, merchants don't have much to sell, and prices spike
* You can have your colonists do trade routes with other players, trading goods for other goods or money at a pre-agreed rate

#### Multiplayer
* Should support at least 10 players running on a dedicated server
* Diplomacy system enabling various treaties (As well as war)
	* Peace treaty, trade treaty, defensive pact, Alliance
* You can claim territory by building a special structure
	* Other players cannot do anything besides pass through unless you give them the correct permissions

#### Enemies
* Enemies will be based upon various mythology, such as Greek mythology, Norse mythology...

#### World
* Procedurally generated world
* Custom world sizes
* Other "Dimensions", with different creatures, plant life, and materials

#### Food
* Everything needs to eat
* You start the game with two different bags of seeds
	* Seed bags never run out
* To get a new type of seed, you have to purchase it from a merchant, or craft a lot of the crop into a seed bag
* Merchants only carry a few seeds of a type, so on a large multiplayer server you will have to trade for it

## Tech and Magic
* Both technology and magic are available
	* Technology is based more upon resource processing and research
	* Magic is based upon character leveling up, learning new spells, and gathering components for permanent spells 

#### Classes
* Various character classes exist
	* Wizard, Cleric, Thief, Paladin, Necromancer (Evil Cleric), Monk, Warrior, Knight
		*Each of these can have subclasses
* Characters with classes like above are not really capable of participating in the tech progression
	* They aren't allowed to research technology or construct tech items
* When a character levels up, they can choose to gain various abilities
	* At low levels, they are allowed to instantly choose which abilities they get when leveling up
	* At high levels, they may level up, but to actually get a new ability and spend ability Point2Ds they need to be trained by a trainer in that specific skill

#### Skills
* Everything is a skill
* Construction, Mining, Hauling, shooting, melee, research, trading
* Even things from RPG classes are skills
	* Just because the wizard gained the ability to cast a new spell, doesn't mean he is good at casting that spell
	* Fighters have to get good at the various moves and abilities they learn

#### Technologies
* The tech tree starts in basically the stone age
* You know how to make fire, hunt, and make crude weapons and tools
* Tech tree ends in the far off future, where everything is digital, artificial intelligence runs your base, and the dying can be healed of everything

#### Magic
* There is a spell for doing almost everything
* Spellcasters only know a few spells to begin with
	* They have to find scrolls with the correct words to memorize
* Some spells are permanent, others are one time effects
	*Permanent spells require components, and have a high mana cost
	* Permanent spells can be destroyed/dispelled
* Examples of permanent spells
	*Light, grow crops, intruder alarm...
* Temporary spells
	* Terraform land, fireball, energy bolt, magic barrier...
* Spellcasters only have so much mana, so they can only cast so many spells until they run out
	*Mana is regenerated by sleeping
* Casters of the same type can work together
	* Ex: Two clerics could work together to cast a spell with mana requirements higher than they could meet alone
